                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My name is Lavar Harewood, I am from Brooklyn, NY. I am a recent MBA graduate

                    undergraduate degree in Business Administration. While at South Carolina State I competed on the
                    Men’s Basketball team, where I was a team captain every year that I played. I was also a member of

                    school leagues in the country the NEPSAC. Brooks provided a unique experience that allowed me to be
                    immersed in a rigorous diverse academic environment that prepared me for college on and off the
                    court.<br><br>I am a goal oriented, motivated individual with a demonstrated history of playing high
